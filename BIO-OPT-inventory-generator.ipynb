    "This script generates 100 inventories (in this case, for vanillin production), where the percentage of woodchips allocated to vanillin production decreases from 100% to 1%. The remaining woodchips, not used for vanillin production, are assumed to be burned for steam generation. The amount of steam produced is calculated based on the calorific value (25.17 MJ/kg) and an 80% conversion efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For each percentage of woodchips used for vanillin, the following are calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Steam produced from the remaining woodchips: The amount of woodchips not used for vanillin production is converted into steam using the calorific value of woodchips and the specified efficiency.\n",
    "2. Ash production: 8% of the remaining woodchips are converted into ash after the steam production process.\n",
    "3. Vanillin production: The amount of vanillin produced is directly proportional to the percentage of woodchips used for its production.\n",
    "4. Water usage, energy, and chemical inputs: These are scaled according to the percentage of woodchips used for vanillin production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants:\n",
    "Total woodchips for 100% vanillin production: 0.306 kg<br>\n",

    "The following Python libraries and tools are essential for running the script:\n",

    "1. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for reading and writing data from various file formats. Install with: `pip install pandas==1.3.3`\n",
