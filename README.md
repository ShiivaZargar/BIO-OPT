# Overview
BIO-OPT (Biorefinery Optimization Platform) is an integrated analytical platform designed to evaluate the role of forest biorefineries in achieving a sustainable bioeconomy. This platform integrates Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA), and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) to provide optimal solutions with the lowest Global Warming Potential (GWP) and highest economic returns. The platform is general enough to be applied in various industries beyond biorefineries.

# Features
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): Evaluate the environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from cradle to grave.

Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA): Assess the economic performance of the biorefinery processes.

Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO): Optimize the production processes to achieve the best balance between economic and environmental goals.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
1.	You have installed Python.
2.	You have installed the required Python libraries.

# Usage
## Running the Analysis
1.	Prepare Your Input Data Files:

LCA Data: Create an Excel file containing all the necessary life cycle inventory data (a sample Excel file is provided).

TEA Data: Create an Excel file containing all the economic data required for the techno-economic analysis, such as costs, revenues, and financial parameters (a sample Excel file is provided).

2.	Configure Your Analysis Parameters:

Configure the analysis parameters according to your needs in BIO-OPT-LCA, BIO-OPT-TEA and BIO-OPT-MOO files. The configuration file should specify the paths to the input files and any other parameters required for the analysis.

3.	Execute the main analysis script to start the evaluation and optimization
